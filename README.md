## User Story

As a social media startup I want an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.
<br>
<br>

## Motivation

The purpose of this app is to practice working with MongoDB, mongoose, Express.js, npm, Insomnia, and more.
<br>
<br>

## Acceptance Criteria

WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application, my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.

WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database.

WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia, I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list.
