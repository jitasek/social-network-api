<br>

## Getting Started

Please type the following commands in the terminal in the respective order:

```
git clone git@github.com:jitasek/social-network-api.git
cd social-network-api
code .
git checkout dev
npm i
npm run dev
```

Once done and your server is up and running, you can open Insomnia and check the CRUD operations. To make it easier for you, here is some example data you can use for that purpose:

`Create user:`

```json
{
  "username": "User1",
  "email": "a@a.com"
}
```

`Update user:`

```json
{
  "email": "haha@haha.com"
}
```

`Create thought:`

```json
{
  "thoughtText": "* * * Thought of programming * * *",
  "username": "User1"
}
```

`Update thought:`

```json
{
  "thoughtText": "An updated thought text"
}
```

`Delete thought:`

```json
{
  "userId": "6208ef138623ea5cbed16b50"
}
```

`Add reaction:`

```json
{
  "reactionBody": "TOP reaction...",
  "username": "User2"
}
```

<br>

## User Story

```md
As a social media startup I want an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.
```

<br>

## Motivation

The purpose of this app is to practice working with `MongoDB`, `mongoose`, `Express.js`, `npm`, `Insomnia`, and more.
<br>
<br>

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application, my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.

WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database.

WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia, I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list.
```
